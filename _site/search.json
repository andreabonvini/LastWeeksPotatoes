It means that phosphorus\nthat is in the brain of a rat—and also in mine, and yours—is not the\nsame phosphorus as it was two weeks ago. It means the atoms that are in\nthe brain are being replaced: the ones that were there before have gone\naway. So what is this mind of ours: what are these atoms with\nconsciousness? Last week’s potatoes! They now can remember what was\ngoing on in my mind a year ago—a mind which has long ago been replaced.\nTo note that the thing I call my individuality is only a pattern or\ndance, that is what it means when one discovers how long it takes for\nthe atoms of the brain to be replaced by other atoms. The atoms come\ninto my brain, dance a dance, and then go out—there are always new\natoms, but always doing the same dance, remembering what the dance was\nyesterday.”\n― Richard Feynman, What Do You Care\nWhat Other People Think?\n\nAndrea\nBonvini\n\n\n  Email me \n\n\n\n  GitHub \n\n\n  LinkedIn  \n\n\n  Instagram \n\n\n\n\n",
